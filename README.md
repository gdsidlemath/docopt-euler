# Project Euler Program Repo

Repository for programs that solve [project
Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems in multiple languages. The
initial solution _should_ be done in *Python*, then implemented in *Go* and
*C++*, and then, if I feel extra motivated, in *Ruby*.


This repo uses `Docopt` as a documentation and command-line argument parsing
tool. It is available for Python [here](https://github.com/docopt/docopt), for
Go [here](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.go), for C++
[here](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.cpp), and for Ruby
[here](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.rb), but
is included in the requirements for each individual repo as well, as well as
installation instructions there.
